Release Notes:

1.7.6 -- 2018.09.11
* Make overload of instantiator with DropZoneConfig object public access.

1.7.5 -- 2018.09.09
* Nuget package updates

1.7.4 -- 2018.09.09
* Add body size limit of 5Mb to Api calls for payload dropoff and set reference, and 1,024 for admin calls.

1.7.3 -- 2018.08.29
* Refactor FailedAuthTokenWatch to ClientWatch, with simplier property structure.
* Remove 451 (Legal Reasons) return codes and use only 401 (Not Authorized) return codes.
  Separate return values provided a semaphore to attackers of when their attempts were being ignored or not.
  Now all attempts appear valid.
* Add overridable parameters for:
  ** Drop zone count
  ** Max failed attempts before lockout
  ** Lockout seconds of duration
* Created lockout logic that will return not authorized when a valid access token is provided during a lockout period.
  This can give the impression to brute force attackers that they still have not discovered the proper value.
* GetReference will now return a 204 response if the key does not exist.  Previously, it would have return a value of 
  empty string.
